# Data Analysis with R


## What is EDA?

### EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

### [Facebook processes more than 500 terabyte of data a day (2012](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-processes-more-than-500-tb-of-data-daily/)). I wonder how much it processes now … How do they manage all that storage. It’s insane!

- Facebook uses a database called Presto. It’s mainly used for adhoc analysis. This thing processes 1 petabyte of data per day! I wonder how Presto is so fast in getting the data! Does that mean all that data is up on memory?

### [https://trends.google.com/trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)/ -> You can use google trends to do some big data analysis. Well to be precise, EDA.

### Why you should do this! [Netflix Prize & Netflix Prize Dataset Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize). Because of thiiiis :)

### [http://flowingdata.com/2009/09/23/tv-size-over-the-past-8-years](http://flowingdata.com/2009/09/23/tv-size-over-the-past-8-years/)/ -> Conducting what he did on his work. 

- He used histograms, and gave a chart line to the median tv size. Also, he described where he got the data. 

### We’ll be using the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) in this course. 

## R Basics

### I think that learning from other people is the best way. Especially, people do their data analysis exploration. And write them through their blogs. I should find these kinds of articles!

- There should be more articles like this in this course. So keep adding them and find them yourself when you get the time.

### Why R? R is the leading language for statistics and data analysis(I’m not sure whether this is true anymore since Python grew really big). The community is active and etc. I wonder if R can handle things like Jupiter notebook can. 

- Yes I just did a search and I got the IRkernel. So, Jupiter notebook takes in a kernel eh? I wonder how Jupiter notebook works. 

- I did some research and installed the IRKernel and did it on Jupiter notebook. I’m not sure whether Jupiter Notebook can do some R Markdown stuff. As you can see over [here](http://minimaxir.com/2017/06/r-notebooks/), he says R Notebooks have way more advantages than jupyter.

	- They call this field the reproducible data analysis!

	- Well, there is a plot twist. You can use python in the R notebook!!! This is absolutely insane. Well the poor thing is that you can only do ad-hoc stuff since the python session doesn’t go on.

### I’ve learned these commands: c, nchar, data, str, dim, names, row.names, head, and tail.  Also learned that R is not zero-based for arrays! Or they call, vectors and data frames.

### Factor Variables

- Put the links in the markdown file. But well, you can just google it. When I scratched the surface, it’s a data type in R. 

### Data Wrangling, munging, I have to know how to do these. I think it’s a process of making your data clean, and getting the data that you want in one place where you can get it real easy. 

### I got some advices from the Facebook data scientists in one of the videos. It was really good advice. “It’s the question that should be thought of, not the tools and fuzzy stuff.” Ask questions that people actually will care. Make them consume the data and make them care too. 

- Asking the right questions, exploring, solving, and also making your curiosities. Ask yourself what your most curious of. 

- I better go get bitcoin and stock data to analyze it. Find the real factors that impact the market, you have to get to know the market man. Also use some technical analysis factors to make your trading algorithm better.
