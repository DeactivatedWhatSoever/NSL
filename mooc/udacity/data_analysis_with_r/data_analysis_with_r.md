# Data Analysis with R


## What is EDA?

### EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

### [Facebook processes more than 500 terabyte of data a day (2012](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-processes-more-than-500-tb-of-data-daily/)). I wonder how much it processes now … How do they manage all that storage. It’s insane!

- Facebook uses a database called Presto. It’s mainly used for adhoc analysis. This thing processes 1 petabyte of data per day! I wonder how Presto is so fast in getting the data! Does that mean all that data is up on memory?

### [https://trends.google.com/trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)/ -> You can use google trends to do some big data analysis. Well to be precise, EDA.

### Why you should do this! [Netflix Prize & Netflix Prize Dataset Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize). Because of thiiiis :)

### [http://flowingdata.com/2009/09/23/tv-size-over-the-past-8-years](http://flowingdata.com/2009/09/23/tv-size-over-the-past-8-years/)/ -> Conducting what he did on his work. 

- He used histograms, and gave a chart line to the median tv size. Also, he described where he got the data. 

### We’ll be using the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) in this course.
