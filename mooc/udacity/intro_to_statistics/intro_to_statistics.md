# Intro to Statistics


## Teaser

### How to see if you’re unpopular. Your friends will have a way more better chance of having friends! Didn’t know that. The ‘expectation’ is. So we’ll be learning how to actually do this and understand this. 

- I didn’t get most of the quizzes right. I only got one right lol. As you can see, I’m mostly bad at everything in the start. But I’ll get there, so wait and see :)

### This class is a basic intro, it’ll teach me how to visualize, summarize, test, and find trends. Absolutely needed knowledge for trading. I’ll love this.

### I’ll have to tackle on the challenges and programming problem sets. They are optional but, to make me better in this, I’d better be doing them both. I’ll do the programming assignments in R or Python. But I think I’ll go with Python, well don’t know at the moment though.

## Looking at Data

### Statistics is something that makes people decide things from data. The data itself with no interoperation will have no information. But when we use statistics on the data, we’ll get some insight and will be able to decide the things that we want with the data.

### The first quiz is about valuing houses. 

- First, we need some variables to decide whether to buy a house. The biggest factor of the price is the house’s size in square foot. So we get some data, sold recently in that square foot and list them. Find the house that I want to buy! Just look it up from the data. That’s what I learned on the first quiz.

- Also, if the size is not on the list, you could find the average of the cost! But that data won’t be that much correct. 

- You can also get the cost of a square foot! Getting a constant in the data is extremely rare. So don’t think it’ll be like that the next time!
