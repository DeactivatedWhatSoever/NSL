# Intro To Data Analysis


## Data Analysis Process

### This lesson describes of the process of data analysis. How and where to get data, wrangling the data, etc. 

- First, the data acquisition state. 

- To do data analysis, I think you need to be very curious about the data. What it contains, what you can do with it, and what you can know about it. This is the question phase.

### You must investigate problems in the data. Like whether the count is not correct or etc.

- Identify surprising data points

- Print out one or a few surprising points

- Fix any problems you find

- Data must be clean! It has to have reasons when the data doesn’t match. 

### Explore Phase

### Indulge Curiosity

- You have to get curious and know about your data. So exploring your data will never be a waste of time for a data analyst. 

### Statistics

- Man, I have to do some statistics. Learn em! I didn’t know what mean and standard deviation was. Gotta know em.

### Drawing Conclusions / Predicting Results Phase

- Where you visualize the data you analyzed!

- To get a better idea of how to get more conclusions, you need to have some knowledge in statistics.

	- [Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)

- If you want to know correlation of two groups, you need to find out yourself. You can run A/B tests to find out more!

- Making Predictions. It’s an essential part of data analysis. We need to know a whole lot of information to actually predict. 

	- Machine learning can make predictions automatically. Making predictions by hand will be pretty hard and time consuming. So search an algorithm and train it with that.

### Communication Phase

- Show histograms, polish visualizations, with D3.js or whatever.

### Data Science vs Data Analysis

- Data science is rather like a ranking ‘system’, or a recommendation ‘system’. And analysis is really like a blog post or a visualization as a result.
