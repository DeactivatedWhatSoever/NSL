# Intro to Data Analysis
I'm just going to listen to lesson one. Since it just gives me the overall idea of what a data analyst does and what kind of skills I'll need to actually do that stuff. I saw that all the other lessons(which are 2 and 3) only teach about using Pandas, Numpy and those libraries you use for data analysis. I'm going to learn that stuff in the `Python for Data Analysis` book.
