# Software Architecture


## Week 1

### Architecture Overview and Process

- Software architecture isn’t actually the technical part. It’s where you communicate with all the humans that are in part of the project. The people who are going to benefit of the software that you’re going to build. 

- So that’s why architects mostly view things with the UML diagrams or the even higher, specs and actions. They try to solve the problems in the higher level of something. 

### Communicating Architecture

- Kruchten’s 4 + 1 Model View

	- This is actually how you view the software and how you’re going to architect it.

	- Logical View

		- Actual functions of the software.

	- Process View

		- The performance, scalability of the software.

	- Development View

		- The software components that you need to build the software, toolsets, libraries, programming languages, etc.

	- Physical View

		- Where the software is going to be executed. The actual servers, environment etc.

	- You have to think of all the views and the UML crash course will show each step how to describe the views in UML.

- UML Component Diagram

- UML Package Diagram

- UML Deployment Diagram

- UML Activity Diagram

- I’m thinking of learning the UML diagram usage some other time. I bet there will be a great book about it and when I become a software architect, I would need to draw these. But in South Korea, I never get the chance to actually use this stuff. If I ever get a chance to build a huge system from scratch, I think I would go and read a book about it and just write it down again.
