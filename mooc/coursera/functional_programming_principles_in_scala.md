# Functional Programming Principles in Scala
The reason I’m taking this course is because of the knowledge that I need to program with a functional mindset. I need to know how to calculate and compute stuff in lambda, passing and returning behavior around, all that stuff. Trying to make everything immutable etc. 
 The next course to take is `Functional Program Design in Scala`. It’ll help me get to know how to design functional programs. How to build from top and how to actually design code that is functional. I should go and learn how to write tests while doing this. If I don’t I think I’ll keep on not doing that stuff.
