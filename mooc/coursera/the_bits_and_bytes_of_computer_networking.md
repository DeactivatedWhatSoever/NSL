# The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking
What this course? 
-> I saw all the network introductory books. They had a lot of OSI model and TCP/IP stuff, but really didn’t made my mind in it. I think it would be way better to just visualize the networking flow. Which would be in a course. I know there would be diagrams in the book as well, but courses are way better since their videos and have a lot of interaction. Also, Google made this. Let’s trust Google. 
* Getting to know how the internet works
* Understanding the flow of the OSI model
	* Of course I got to know that it goes up and down the layer
	* The devices do some networking in their layer, but I wonder how they get all the data for the other protocols? This is my next question
* How to troubleshoot networking issues
