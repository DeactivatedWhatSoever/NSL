# A Tour of Go
It’s the official Golang tour. Let’s get the overall stuff and go for the language spec. I can’t believe there’s a language that’s actually readable! I really want to actually get better with Scala and Java and all those other languages, but still. A systems language. Something that I really want to actually think of and … yeah. I want to actually learn a language really deeply. And of course it’ll be great if it’s a systems language. So I’ll be able to get along with C/C++ a bit faster. 
 I’m not sure whether I’ll get to learn Scala/Java more, but I’m going to get familiar with Go and see whether it’ll be good or not. 

# Using the tour
It’s just about how to use the tour. You can use it by opening up a localhost server, even offline and tells you about the [Go playground.](https://play.golang.org/). 
 There’s really not much anything to see over here so I’ll just skip all the big stuff.
