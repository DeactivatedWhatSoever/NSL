# Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit
Okie dokie. Now, this is the place where I get to learn testing! Yeeeep. That’s all. Testing is a must these days, and I have not been doing that for a long long time. Can’t believe you haven’t done anything like that. You should’ve done it when you had the chance. But since you’re doing it now, I’m very disappointed in you! Let’s get on with it, and make our code ‘believable’. 

## Unit-Testing Foundations
What do you think you’re going to learn? 
-> Since this is a big part, I’d say, getting started with unit testing stuff. Like setting up the environment, what rules you have to follow, how to make tests, and tell you about what kind of code you should actually write down. That’s the foundations! I hope I get to ‘know’ the intuitive sense of writing proper tests. Like how much is enough, when should I stop, what should I test, all that kind of stuff. 
 Also, there’s some articles that writing test code makes my code really dependent. Which means bad architecture. How to get over this flaw? How does it actually happen? I would really love to know and find a way to solve that problem.
