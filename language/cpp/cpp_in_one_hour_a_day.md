# C++ in One Hour a Day
For competitive programming. And one day, I hope to replace Java with C++. For the greater good of performance!

# Introduction
So C++11, which is 2011, made a lot of enhancements for developer performance. And it gave a better impression at C++14. Feels like android 5.0 to 6.0.
 I’m not going to use the Microsoft’s Visual C++ compiler. I’m going to use GNU. I wonder what differs from them. 

Basics, OOP, STL(Data Structures), STL(Algorithms), Advanced Features + C++17. That’s what we got in this book! Let’s get it! STL also has lambda expressions, so I think it’ll be a good way to understand. I don’t know whether functions are first-class citizens over here though. But lambdas, I think if that’s here, then isn’t it true?
