# Scala Official Documentation


## Introduction

### Welcome to the tour

- Well you should just go and read the Scala Programming Language book that everyone has lol. But I’m not really sure whether to put in a lot of time into this language. But yeah, I think you’ll be processing a lot of data. Look at all those machines .... 

- And also, when you’re fiddling with financial data, I bet you’ll have to process a lot. Even when you do sentinel analysis, you’ll have to crawl a hell lot of text.

### What is Scala?

- Scalable Language. That’s what Scala is. Does it mean in concurrency? Throughput? Or low memory consumption plus efficient memory usage? Type-safe, multi-paradigm. OOP + FP.

### Scala is object-oriented

- Every value is an object. Classes and traits. Traits came out over here. Which means there’s no interfaces. Well the internet says it’s pretty much the same with Java 8 interfaces. They say something about mixii-based composition and that’ll make a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.

- Okay, while you’re actually learning OOP over here, well, a refresher, you should go and see what Cypher told you about the ‘extends’ keyword. How it actually destroyed a lot of people’s code. 

### Scala is functional

- Every function is a value. Well, this means functions are treated as an object. Because everything value is an object, then every function is a value, every function is an object!

- There’s a lot of FP stuff, such as higher-order functions, nested functions (decorators), currying, case classes, pattern matching, singleton ‘objects’(Only functions). 

### Scala is statically typed

- It’s pretty cool that Scala tried to make pure OOP by not using the primitive types in Java. So in Scala, the primitive types are boxed types and when it compiles, the compiler will tell whether the type will be boxed or unboxed in java byte code.

- Still, it supports generic classes, variance annotations, upper and lower type bounds, inner classes and abstract types as object members, compound types, explicitly typed self references, implicit parameters and conversions, polymorphic methods, type inference

	- Yeah, you should go find about dynamic typing vs type inference.

	- Type inference: the user doesn’t need to annotate code with TMI. Which means, you don’t need to declare the type explicitly.

### Scala is extensible

- Can’t believe that this language is extensible like just creating extensions in a form of libraries. That’ll be really cool if you actually know all the internal stuff. Like, if you want something from Python, you could just implement it in Scala. Well I bet other people would have done this. But not a lot.

- Implicit classes, String interpolation are pretty much good examples to look at.

### Scala interoperates

- Scala can compile into Java. It has the same compilation model. All the other stuff like Java specific language functions will be compiled as close as possible. This means, that Scala can use Java libraries. This is what it means by ‘interoperates’.
