I need to know who I'm fighting with, and when I know who to fight with, I'll be able to use it and plan how to trade way better. Know your enemy!

## Insider Traders
The people who have the core information that can actually manipulate the price. 

### Coinbase - The Bitcoin Cash Incident
I think this is a great example of insider trading. Someone knew that Coinbase was going to list Bitcoin Cash. That's why bitcoin cash went so high. Even before the god damn release! 

### South Korea Financial Supervisory Service
Yep, Korean people did insider trading lol. 

## Whales
People who have a lot of capital. They can manipulate the market price easily. I'll give you some examples of what they do.

### Stop-loss hunting
They try to find the stop-loss price orders. And then buy all the stop-loss coins and then wait for the market to recover. They just drive the price down! Damn it.

### Short/Long Hunting
The whales try to find 100x leverages and just turn the price a little and buy all the liquidations and make the traders who made leverage get liquidated. 

### Spoofing
Just buy or sell a whole lot and then cancel all the orders! I've seen a lot of this lol. 

### Wash Trading
Just manipulating the market, but looks like spoofing a little bit, but they really trade like as if they are real traders. So it's really hard to prove.

## Pump & Dump Group Executives
Yep, I've put in some money over here, but mostly, it sucks. I lost a lot from here and I'm going to make an algorithm that finds these executives and I'll profit out of them.

## So you're telling me the game is rigged and I'm bon ed, what should I do?
