# Insider Buy Super Stocks


## My Story

### This guy lost 6 times to Mr. Market. Which absolutely is real cool. He won and he lost. He didn’t sell at the right time lol. Pretty much a real sad thing to see. 

### He studied everything that he could. The education pulled off! Learned about every chart patterns, and found a mentor. He also tracked down all the people who actually accomplished the system of that mentor. 

### He checked whether the market was oversold or overbought

### Actually, there are only few variables that determine everything!

## Today is the Day to Divorce Yourself from Mediocrity

### You have to learn to think independently. 

### The thing is, you have to lower the trades! If you start to over trade, then you will be taking more risk and lose in the long time. 

- Losing in the market is absolutely inevitable. So, you have to get big when you actually win. That’s why we’re searching for superstocks. Just keep looking, and when you identify one, that’s just the tip of the ice-burg. You have to ‘validate’. 

### You have to take ‘calculated’ risks. Not risks that just base on your emotions. That’ll be just buying and selling like everyone else. 

- Let’s learn how to actually calculate risk. That’s how we can find our optimum buy and sell zone right?

### What to do if I’m crazy about investing!

- Do you have the drive, determination, passion, and time required to break free of investment conditioning?

- Are you hungry to learn?

- Do you have an incredible belief in what is possible?

- Do you have a high tolerance for calculated risk and the emotional ability to endure the inevitable ups and downs? 

- Will you be able to nurture an open mind to spot the obvious? 

- Are you willing to implement self-discipline in every aspect of your investing?

- ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE A HUGE STEP FORWARD TO TAKE ACTION TO DESTROY YOUR BOND WITH INVESTMENT MEDIOCRITY?

### Don’t be the same as all the other people. You have to make your ‘own’ perspective. 

- Which is being the 1% :)

### Being rich is the most important thing. If you keep trying to be right and valid, that means you want to show off your skills to the public. That’s all. 

- Well being rich than right would actually mean, don’t go bloating to others and stop wasting time. That’s the most important thing. 

### From Right or Rich, there’s also something else to think about. You have to think with yourself. Just you. Isolation is a key factor for trading. That’s why I had an intuitive feeling that trading should be done alone. Not going with the herd, or a group, news, etc. It’s a real problem if you keep on following everyone’s back. 

- Think with your own mind. Brain storming doesn’t really give you ideas. You actually lose creativity within the group. 

## The Most Potent Drug the World Has Ever Seen

### One of the biggest drugs that in this chapter means is, the news from CNBC, and those financial news. This makes you ‘group think’. Which isn’t a good thing. You have to get your own views and if those views are not on the internet or only some blog posts that are not really much viewed, then there will be a big chance that trade is going to turn big. 

- Try to avoid the news and avoid ‘future predictions’. This will manipulate your mind and make you move like the others. They’ll keep on trying to make you move and make you do what they want. 

### All the news will MAKE YOU TRADE! Overtrade. Overtrading is one of the things that you must avoid. If you trade too much, you’ll absolutely lost a lot of your money. Well you’re actually taking more ‘risks’. And they one be that much ‘calculated’. 

- You have to remember that the stocks that are getting the biggest gains are stocks that aren’t really getting any interest from the media, or people. Well people that don’t really get affected by the media :)

### Crowd psychology is ALWAYS wrong about critical market turning points.

- Yep, I’m reading about what mass media does! It tells, actually screaming at me that they are ALWAYS wrong.

### The headlines will give you a clue of what the financial sector is doing. You must think of what they are doing and what they are trying to do with you. If you just follow them, you’ll tend to lose your money. Remember, the people can lie, but the charts can’t lie.

### The mystical Drudge market indicator.

### The most important thing for you to do is, spot the manipulation. If you start finding headlines of what the media is talking about, you’d better start to move or start to get out of that place. If you keep going in there, it’ll crash. Everything is manipulation and lies. I hope you don’t fall into them.

## Wall Street’s Worst Kept Secret

### What I read over here was mostly about mass media, and what Goldman Sachs did to manipulate all the traders. It looked like a crime when I read everything. They make a call, and after about a few weeks, everything goes reversal. 

- When I first listened to that lecture at ohmyschool, I found out that they manipulate it, and everyone gets in at the top. After that, all the banks or the people who have a lot of money starts to sell everything and then it’s finished. 

### The most important thing that I read over here is self discipline. I have to stop looking at those ‘calls’. If I keep on listening to those calls, then I’ll be just putting in money the way they want. 

- For ETC as an example, They don’t want to make the price to fall that much. Well, they could actually want to buy it since it falls too much. After that, they’ll be able to actually sell it at a high price because of the hard fork. It will eventually go high because they have to sell high.

### Yep, they are the kings of manipulation. 

## Becoming a Better Trader

### This is a pretty hard task. You have to find trading mentors. You have to learn with the best. How can I find the best traders? Now this is pretty much a hard one. I have to find them!

### I have to know a little bit about economics, but the thing that I need to know more is understanding mass psychology. It’s more than the humans who are making the charts.

- Trading in the zone - Mark Douglas. You should read this, because it tells you a lot about mass psychology in the market.

### To trade, you have to be really confident. 

### You have to visualize your stock. If the stock that you picked start to go to the way you did, what are you going to do? What happens when it goes against you? What should you do then? You have to have all the plans. All possibilities. Whether you’re going to go with stop-loss or whatever.

### If you start getting really negative about the market and you can’t find a super stock, that means its time for you rest from trading. That’s a really important thing to do. If you keep on trading while you have negative emotions about the market, that means it’s time to rest.

- Which means, you have to be optimistic about the future. That’s why Bill Gates and all those other guys succeeded. They view they world optimistically.

### When you keep on searching for your super stock, you have to be really confident about it. If you aren’t really confident, you must re-evaluate your stock. 

### Woah, a really cool saying. You shouldn’t be overconfident. Nothing should be ‘over’ the line. Everything needs to have its line. Which means, as a general rule, losses make you strong and profits make you weak.

### DISCIPLINE. A real word that needs to be formed in the trading market. You have to be CONSISTENT. Stick to the rules that you made. 

- Select stocks

- How to enter and exit positions

- Reacts to stock volatility

### You have to destroy your fear when trading. Because of fear(when the stock goes down) you eventually sell it because of fear! You will just lose everything! If you lose a lot from the first time, that wasn’t your optimal entering point. You have to learn from your mistakes and not try to do it again. Remember, don’t create fear or any emotional trades. That’s where you lose everything.

### Emotions kill your trading. Remember when you sell a stock and that stock flies away? You’ll think if only I had some patience! Well, you should get some patience by thinking about your own universe. You have to do your stuff while trading. Try to get out of everything. This is a long run of life. You can make your millions in the years, don’t worry. Just give relaxing faith.

### To make a fat pitch trade, you have to know when the market has an edge for you. If you don’t have an edge, you shouldn’t think about it. You get fearful when everyone is greedy, and you get greedy when everyone is fearful.

### Achieving peak performance. This thing is actually from the book called “Flow - The psychology of original experience.” -> Should read!

### Like what I learned from study code, you have to have a tidy environment, and that environment needs to make you work as hard as possible.

- Also, if you dwell in an environment too long, you should try giving it a change. Go to Starbucks, anywhere else like that and try to give a refresh for you.

### Music could help you. Especially music that doesn’t have vocals. You know this fact :)

### Something that I learned. You have to be healthy. To be healthy, you need to exercise, be choosy of what you eat. 

- You should go boxing, eat things that don’t make you fat in the weekend or night. I think that’ll be really nice for you actually! Don’t eat dinner at work. Eat stuff by yourself. Which will be great for you. Try out diets, try out things that will make you healthier than ever. I think it really is an important factor since you grown fat these days ...

## Systems and Simplicity

### The writer actually has a simple method. The chart needs to have an outstanding great pattern, there should be insider stock buying. All the other variables and stuff.   Also, he does more research on sentimental and psychologic stuff.

### The most important thing is creating your own view of the market. 

- Keep it simple stupid

### Pareto Principal!

### We want secrets!!!! That’s our ego. 

### You have to master chart patterns since they are just emotion written in to graphic! They all have the most possibilities and potential in it.

### First, you need to study the chart patterns and select what charts actually have the STRONGEST signals. That stock is going to be the super stock.

### Discover “undiscovered company stories”. Don’t even think about following stories that everyone know. That’ll be mass media manipulation.
