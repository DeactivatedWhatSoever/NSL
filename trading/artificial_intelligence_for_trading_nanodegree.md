# Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree
It's time for me to become a Quant.

## Welcome to the Nanodegree Program
It's just a welcome lesson. But the thing here to actually get is, how to get a lot from this class, and try to understand what you're trying to be. What kind of skills you'll be acquiring and stuff. 

### Welcome!
Just a welcome message and stuff. An introduction of the constructors. 

### What is a Quant?
The people who find the `Truth`. It's in the books "The Quants". They work in a lot of places, but mostly financial related companies. You need to use scientific methods with the understanding of markets, the intuition, or whatever. 
 Issac Newton can predict the heavens, but he can't predict the people of madness. 

### Your Instructors
Miriam, Cindy, Jonathan, Brok, Liz, Eddy, Arpan, Kendall, Justin, Harry, Murat
 So many people ... 

### Program Overview
I'll need to get a refresher of linear algebra and statistics. Also, I need to be able to use Numpy and Pandas. I already know Python and how to use Jupyter Notebooks already. 

### Tell Us About Yourself
It was just a survey lol.

### Student Support
* Getting Help
* Project Reviews
* Study Groups -> Chat platform with students
* Knowledge -> Just a simple Q&A platform

### Feedback
If you want to provide feedback to the Udacity team, use the Waffle Board! And keep giving lesson feedbacks when you finish a lesson. 

### Career Support
How to become a Quant. Mostly the fact is, quant trading talent is acquired from the top 20 universities. But the firms started to think that those students could not be the best talent. So they're using Udacity to find the best talent outside of the top 20 universities. I hope to be that talent, and I will get it. 

We can get great feedback of our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. From this, we can actually get to know what we're actually doing, what we're trying to give to the people who want to hire me. Anyways, it's a great curriculum that Udacity gives for career support.

#### Connect to Hiring Partners through your Udacity Professional Profile
Maybe I could get a cool job through Udacity! Maybe people over here could actually find me! Let's try and get my Udacity profile shining! 

### Time Management
Okay, it's like one project for two weeks. Let's get it done.
