# Quantitative Trading
I’m reading this book to actually get a proper overview. The Udacity nano degree was somewhat hard and not really nice. I think it’s better for me to think as I read. I need a slow method. I can’t go with a fast one that throws at my face. 
 I think courses are best when I actually know a little about the material. If not, it’s really hard to understand right away. 
 Let’s get started with the overview of quantitative trading. 

# The Whats, Who’s, and Whys of Quantitative Trading
Quantitative trading === algorithmic trading. Algorithms. Things that can be quantifiable, that’s the key. We can have technical analysis in this party, but we can’t quantify subjective chart patterns like “head and shoulder” etc. Subjective things can’t be quantifiable. But, if we get to know the quantifiable formula that draws a head and shoulders, then it could become a strategy. Even though, it’s hard to just think that a chart pattern will come out and we could buy/sell on that pattern. You never know, because the whales already know what they’re going to do with the chart. They draw it. 

Anything that you can make into bits and bytes and use it for trading, it’s quantitative trading.

## Who can become a quantitative trader?
It tells us that anyone can become a quantitative trader. The author actually was a dude that had a cool PhD from Cornell in physics and went to IBM Watson for research. After that he went into financial institutes like Morgan Stanley and etc. But when he used advanced techniques in quantitative trading, he mostly got a whole lot of losses. After that, he started to trade for himself with really simple methods, and suddenly, he gained profit. The moral of this story is obviously keeping, creating everything simple. Not complex to simpl’er’. 
 A typical mindset for anything you do, but this mindset is really important. Not trying to make money right away. Instant wealth should not be the thing that you should get. But I’m willing to take the risk of instant wealth when I have no money. We need a start, and if you don’t have that start, it won’t be easy to grow your money.

## The business case for quantitative trading
This dude said perhaps any small initial is 50k. God damn it lol. Anyways, the factors that we need to have for a quantitative trading fund is:

### Scalability
`Leverage` is key. If you want to scale up a company, you need to go to a venture capital and see how much you can get. Or else you can’t scale. Unless your revenue went way up. IT companies are pretty cool since the more users you get, the more revenue. If you have a ad network lol. 
 In quantitative trading funds, all you need is leverage. You make leverage, and you make that much money. So you scale up until you don’t need to leverage anymore. 

### Demand on Time
The initial time that you need to spend is building your own infrastructure. I’m sure it’ll take some time, but after that, it’s all research and making your infrastructure better and better. There’s nothing else to than that. 
 The more you automate, the less time you need to spend on manual operations. It’s a business that you can actually automate yourself. Maybe some cloud computing resources might be needed, but I think that’ll be pretty unnecessary. I would like to use ubuntu as my desktop computer, but that doesn’t really give the tips and tricks for everything. But still, if you want to do machine learning, I’m sure that’ll be a huge thing to have. That’s something that I should put in when I actually have the money to execute that stuff. 
 Anyways, after you automate the process of trading when the market opens and closes, all the other time that you have is your free time. I’ll use all that time for research, or maybe for the company that I go to. At first, I’ll need to do some work at my company, and just do this and that. 
 Do you know what’s good? Do you know why I need to get into a quant firm? I can use that time to build my infrastructure, AND the firm’s infrastructure. Which means all I get to do is actually research and research. I need to make that state and get better and better. 

### The Nonnecessity of Marketing
Nothing but the price. We need no marketing. Of course trading for other people’s money is obviously real god damn stressful and hard. Something that I’ll do when I get into a quantitative trading firm. 
 Remember, no need of marketing.

## The way forward
* How do you find the right strategy to trade?
* How do you recognize a good versus a bad strategy even before devoting any time to backtesting them?
* How do you rigorously backtest them?
* If the backtest performance is good, what steps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both the business structure and the technological infrastructure?
* If the strategy is profitable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale up the capital to make it into a growing income stream while managing the inevitable (but hopefully, only occasional) losses that come with trading?
