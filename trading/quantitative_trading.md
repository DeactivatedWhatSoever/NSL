# Quantitative Trading
I’m reading this book to actually get a proper overview. The Udacity nano degree was somewhat hard and not really nice. I think it’s better for me to think as I read. I need a slow method. I can’t go with a fast one that throws at my face. 
 I think courses are best when I actually know a little about the material. If not, it’s really hard to understand right away. 
 Let’s get started with the overview of quantitative trading.
