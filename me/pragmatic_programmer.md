# Pragmatic Programming


## Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

### What I was thinking. Software craftmanship, being intuitive and thinking about the context dependently. Being able to learn and understand the new stuff that’s coming out is important. Don’t get lazy about learning. If you get lazy, you’ll just be a guy that just follows around stuff. If you find something that you really want to do, then that’ll be the best part or be

### The Cat Ate My Source Code

- Well, I think it’s important to know when to ask for help. They can’t do my work, but they’ll help me to get a better and faster solution for me job. Of course I have to do it. What are great teammates for!   
   Having code craftsmanship is real important over here. Since all the code that you write is yours. You shouldn’t let others make fun of your code. Your code must make other people get better in their work. An actual reference! If your code is buggy, you must know some time to actually craft that code again. Refactor, clean your own dog poop.   
   Don’t make non understandable excuses. Think about the conversation that will go between the CTO. He’ll tell you whether you’ve tried this or that. Or even say you ruined the job. Please think! 

	- Thinking about the challenge. Well if someone came to me with an excuse that’s bad, I’ll give them advice. Whether to do this or that. Maybe I could look at it a little and make them understand. But still, if they just say they can’t do it, I won’t be able to talk with them in a pleasant tone. 

### Software Entropy

- What if I told you, whether the codebase is dirty or not, what will you do? How will you react to dirtyir clean code?  
   Entropy in this world is a really important notion. If something ‘starts’ to get bigger, it gets bigger exponentially. Same as with dirty code, dirty room, etc. Don’t let everything rot. Maintain it with your craftsmanship. 

### Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- This chapter taught me a good story and about environment adaption mindlessly. I think the most important thing is whether your thinking and self aware of the work going around you.   
   If you don’t look at what’s happening around you, you’ll end up as a boiled frog and be dead. No thinking and just doing your stuff. On the other hand, if you start to make the soup, it means that nothing can be done all at once.   
   You go with your team mates and start adding the ingredients. You did the start, you keep on going. People will help. 

### Good Enough Software

- This is really hard. What is the limit of too much, perfection, or whatever. It’s really hard to measure all that stuff. But this book tells me of requirements. Specifications. Also, thinking about the user side. If you are the user, would you rather a bug filled program that has so much stuff in it? Or few defects and have a simple program to use. I’d take the latter. Besides, I’ll only have simple pains to solve. But the product will evolve if the users tell the company that they have more pains to solve. It will get solved in time. Something to admit is that everything takes time. 

	- It’s best to refine it later, make it more percect time to time. You won’t know whether it’s perfect or not at the meantime. You get to know the problems in the future.   
	   Create something first man. Of course you have to look at the forest and trees side by side. You shouldn’t get into the trees too much or else you won’t be able to deliver the software, nore be perfect. 

### Your Knowledge Portfolio

- Having a knowledge portfolio does mean something important. Because time is limited and you need to find the things you are interested in. Of course you can create curiosity from statting to study the subject. 

- Remeber, new technology can just vanish. You have to invest into a technology that will go long. Even jQuery dies! Let’s face it. Don’t just to into any technology and say you’re going to learn everything. You must learn the thing that’s most in your interest and somethint that will be used broadly in the years. 

	- Buy low and sell high. Until you find one, implement the most fundamental software by yourself :). 

	- You should learn one language a year and a paradigm too. Since those languages will have a paradigm within it. 

	- Should read a technical book a month. Well actually, just read the hell out of everythkng. 

	- Remember to think critically. I got a book for you called thinking fast and slow. It’s actually a critical thing to learn something right and save it right. Make sure there’s no logical flaws. 

### Communicate

- Communication ie a very important factor in our everyday lives. The thing is, you have to make your words as clear as possible. It’s all about listening to the people and make thrm understand what you are saying. 

	- First, it’s thinking about who is going to read or watch your presentation. I think it’s best to think of making your stuff as easy as possible. But there are parts that you must let them know and explain to them. Just like that episode where Jang refactors the writing he did. 

	- Also when to ask to communicate is actually a very important factor. If you just ask around questions without thinking in their shoes, you’ll get rejected and there won’t be any other good things in that result. 

	- Always present your work in a beautiful way. That will pleasant everyone. Content is important, but that doesn’t mean the looks aren’t. Look at food! Something that looks delicious mostly are delicious.

	- Oh, remeber to respond yo everything that comes to you in person. Make them feel that you’re caring about them. So just reply even it’s nothing. 

	- Listen to the people who you are going to talk to. Then you’ll get a chance to talk. 

	- Awk questions and talk with them. Rather than just do nothing and spit out all the words you are going to say. 

	- The most important thing is, know what you are goong to say. If you don’t know what you’re trying to give, there’s no way you’re going to make the audience understand.
