# Pragmatic Programmer
I think this is going to be the start of my software engineering journey. I’m going to focus on the trees for a while. Because, if I don’t know how to do something with one tree, I’ll never be able to do anything with a forest. I have to know the big picture, but I also need to know my trees. It’s time for me to admit that I’m not good at things, and try to get better at that stuff.
