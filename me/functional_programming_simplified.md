# Functional Programming, Simplified
The reason I'm reading this book is, I wanted to learn functional programming in an easy way. It's best to read it in an easy way to actually grasp the material faster. Easier the better right? Well anyways, I'm mostly going to be programming in a functional way from now one since it's pretty much the future. I want to use up the cores of my machine, and also want to speed things up, plus the modularity and code composition. Let's get this on with. Also, I want to read `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`.

## Copyright
Dude, I bought this book. It's okay. And I'm just writing down my study notes, so there won't be any problems I hope. 

## Introduction(or, Why I Wrote This Book)
Let's find out how the author thinks and what his goal is. 

### My programming background
1. How can I write code faster?
2. How can I write maintainable code?

Both of those things are really important to me since I'm working alone. I have to be better that at least 5 programmers, and must be able to write and also see, maintainable code. If the code is maintainable, I bet then I'll be able to write code faster in the future. Also, with TDD, I'll be able to get more time coding instead of testing and fixing bugs. 

### Trying to learn FP with Scala
In the days when the author started, it absolutely wasn't easy for him to study Functional Programming in Scala. The articles were blah, they were very specific on one topic, and people loved talking about `functor`s and `monad`. The thing that I got over here is, since it's not really shown to the public, people who already have the grip of everything are really good at it. So they don't really need to talk about the basic stuff. 
 I think this is why it's harder to get into the verse of where it's not that popular. There's not much resources to learn, even I'm hoping in this book a lot to actually get to the level to understand stuff the people are talking in their blogs.
 But what if I'm studying something else. Something harder. Not functional programming. I'd have to go for it by myself. I totally need to find a way for this. 
* When the field is not popular, how are you going to get a grip on the material. 
* Code everything, PoC, implementation, you have to do it on your own. 

### Learning Haskell to learn FP
Yeah. You can learn functional programming with Haskell since it's a `pure` FP language. When it gets hard, you still have to turn in and use FP principles. So you'll actually be good with Haskell. But the problem is, you'll never get to use it since nobody uses it. 

### The purpose of this book
Cool. I can learn Haskell way easier with this book even if I get a chance to learn Haskell! I'm pretty sure that I won't be getting a go with Haskell since I don't really think that's the future. I might go with Elm, but I'm going to stick with programming in FP with JavaScript. Or TypeScript.
