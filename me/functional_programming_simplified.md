# Functional Programming, Simplified
The reason I'm reading this book is, I wanted to learn functional programming in an easy way. It's best to read it in an easy way to actually grasp the material faster. Easier the better right? Well anyways, I'm mostly going to be programming in a functional way from now one since it's pretty much the future. I want to use up the cores of my machine, and also want to speed things up, plus the modularity and code composition. Let's get this on with. Also, I want to read `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`.
