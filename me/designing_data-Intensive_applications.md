# Designing Data-Intensive Applications
There’s no need to explain about this book. This is what I do. End of story.

# Preface
Going to find out the author’s view of this book and see the overview of what I’m going to learn. 

* Part 1: Think about the fundamental ideas that underpin the design of data-intensive applications. Mostly the reliability, scalability, maintainability relies on the persistence layer is what I think. Servers and all of those dudes can be so cool and performant like Nginx, but because of the repository layer, it’s pretty slow. It has to wait! Data models and encoding. How the storage engine works. What is appropriate?
* Part 2: Data stored in one machine to distributed! Replication, partitioning/sharding, and transactions. Consensus in distributed systems!
* Part 3: Batch processing to stream processing. Also the future!
