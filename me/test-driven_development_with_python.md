# Test-Driven Development with Python
[The Book](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc) -> This is the actual book and it’s free. Which I really can’t believe the author just did all that like that. It’s pretty much a really long book, but it sure does a great job on teaching TDD. I wish to achieve this skill by going around the material and actually get think about the internals of why they made this test case, and how they implemented that test. 

## Preface
The guy really did some research and had a lot of experience on the bright sides of TDD. I wish I had that kind of experience. But the thing is, that you don’t code that much. You don’t make stuff. If you finish book, promise me that you have to actually code something from now on. You have to write code and start to do that stuff. You must be able to just write down code from the tip of your tongue. If you can’t you won’t be able to get to the next level. You need `experience`. 

## Prerequisites and Assumptions
We’ll be using Python 3.6! Which is pretty cool since this book has come out from a certain amount of time. I’m pretty excited to see the code in that way. Hope to get a lot of great conventions in mind. 

Oh yeah, we need drivers to actually run Selenium. It’s a sort of web scraping thing, plus a browser testing framework I think. It’s for UI automation testing. It really is pretty cool if you’re the only one doing all the testing. Just run the tests, and deploy!
