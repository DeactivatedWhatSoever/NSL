# Effective Debugging
I should read a t least one item for each day. It’s because debugging techniques mostly come from case by case scenarios. Of course it’ll go from higher to lower, but these are just techniques. So I felt it would be better for me to actually acquire one item a day. Instead of reading it all, then I won’t be able to remember most of it. Just read one, and try to use it each day. 

# High-Level Strategies
It’s important to know that you have to know the big picture first. So we’ll be finding out about high level stuff first. Forest!

## Handle All Problems through an Issue-Tracking System
It’s pretty much all the things that I know. But there are things that I should remember. Priority, and severity. You should make the issue understandable, KISS. Always write down the people that are involved, and write a really great understandable way to reproduce the problem. 
 Last of all, you should document the progress when you’re tackling down the problem. 

### Things to Remember
* Handle all problems through an issue-tracking system
* Ensure each issue contains a precise description on how to reproduce the problem with a short, self-contained, correct example
* Triage issues and schedule your work based on the priority and severity of each issue
* Document your progress through the issue-tracking system
