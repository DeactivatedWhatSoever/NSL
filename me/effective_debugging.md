# Effective Debugging
I should read a t least one item for each day. It’s because debugging techniques mostly come from case by case scenarios. Of course it’ll go from higher to lower, but these are just techniques. So I felt it would be better for me to actually acquire one item a day. Instead of reading it all, then I won’t be able to remember most of it. Just read one, and try to use it each day.
