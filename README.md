# Never Stop Learning (NSL)
This will be a place to archive what I have learned. The most important thing in learning is, learn until you don't need to look at what you studied ever again. Just pretend, think, or believe that you have photographic memory. Remember how it works, you read something, you comprehend it, and then you can memorize it. You need to know why the thing you studied came out, how it works, then memorization won't be the problem.

One shot, one kill. Always ask yourself, `why` is the most important question that you have to ask.
