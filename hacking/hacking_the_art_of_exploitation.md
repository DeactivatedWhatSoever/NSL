# Hacking: The Art of Exploitation
Hacking. It’s time for me to actually get into this market. I’ve been waiting a lot, and I think you should’ve started faster. Quant trading at day, hacking at night. I think that’s the best way to actually get something done. Love it. Skills that actually make real money. 

# Introduction
Hacking is actually solving problems. The types of problems is just different from programming. 
“It’s trying to find unintended or overlooked uses for the laws and properties of a given situation. “
 It’s just solving problems, but actually finding them? Yeah, it’s just finding bugs and fixing it from the outside right? but I think we should find out more about this. 
 The book shows you about a math problem. Giving an input of some numbers and you have to make a certain number by the combination of the given numbers. We have laws and properties of a given situation. And we try to find the answer? The answer for unintended or overlooked ….
 I should solve the problem. There are multiple answers, and we can see it in the end of the book. But first, I must find out what there are, and see whether I can do it. Creating counterintuitive thought processes is what gives hackers their edge.

Input: 1, 3, 4, 6
Output: 24

“There’s nothing good or bad about knowledge itself; morality lies in the application of knowledge.”

Remember, you have to learn the true spirit of hacking in this book. See how they think, how they get the exploit.
