# Intro to Descriptive Statistics
I’m going to learn statistics with Udacity. I don’t think Coursera or edX will be the better choice since it’ll take too long to actually get stuff inside me. Micro videos and quizzes, and implementing all that stuff into Python by myself might be a better option for me to learn much more. Let’s learn statistics the right way!
