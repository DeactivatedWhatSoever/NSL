# The Probability Lifesaver
Since all the things that I'm trying to do are based on probability and statistics. Machine learning, Quant trading, or anything else that I'm trying to do. I need to know all this stuff and understand the basic nature of all of it. I remember when that famous maths teacher taught probability that well. I want to know this like him. Also, I'm thinking of taking the MIT course after this book.
