# Blockchain & Bitcoin Fundamentals


## What is a Blockchain?

### Tamperproof, unchangeable information.

### Definition:  A Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological and immutable way.

- Thoughts: Why did this technology come out? To make everything permanent. People don’t trust each other that easily. So we just make a permanent contract. Which will be the blockchain. This will make everything permanent, unchangeable. 

- Ledger(은행 사업체 등에서 거래 내역을 적은) 원장? A file that is constantly growing. Chronological -> History. 

## What is Bitcoin?

### It’s a digital asset, cryptocurrency.  Banks have a problem when they send money. People try to duplicate the cash. So they verify every transaction. Which means they’re a middleman. Problems of the “Double Spending” thing. But in bitcoin, it doesn’t need it because of its bitcoin network. The bitcoin network, which is blockchain, decentralizes every transaction so no one can make a fraud of the transaction. 

## The Role of Bitcoin Miners

### The role of a miner is to build the blockchain of records that form the Bitcoin ledger. 

- Permanent? Genesis Block! The first block is the genesis block. Or block 0.

## Hash Functions

### SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm

## Block Hashes

### Building a block?!  Nonce -> Number used once.

## How Block Hashes Work in a Blockchain

### Block 1 doesn’t have a previous hash, but Block 2 will have a previous hash. The blocks have a previous reference with the hash! This is why, it’s a blockchain. 

## The Four Components of Bitcoin

### What are the components? 1. Software! 2. Cryptography 3. Hardware 4. Gaming Theory

### Disintermediated: Removing the middleman. 

### Distributed: The entire network runs on a network of thousands of computers.  Distributing everything on the network. 

### Decentralized: No central control, no management in the middle. 

### Trustless: Nothing needs to make bitcoin verified. 

## Key Concepts in Bitcoin

### Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system.

## The Birth of Bitcoin

### Satoshi!

## The Value of Blockchain

### Intro

- Blockchain Supports 3 Key Areas

	- Value

	- Trust

	- Reliability

### Cryptocurrency

- Digital assets. Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset which can be used to exchange value between parties.  It uses encryption to secure how it’s transferred and to control the creation of new units of that currency.

### Digital Tokens

- Blockchain Tokens = Colored Coins Assign the bitcoin to real world assets.

### Smart Contracts

- Removing the bank while buying other things. The contracts will be automated and disinter mediated. Which will be Executing and Immutable.

### The Birth of Smart Contracts

### DAOs and DACs

- DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAC: Decentralized Autonomous Corporation

	- Collection of smart contracts

	- Distributed networks on a Blockchain

	- IoT

	- Artificial Intelligence

- Everything is automated, immutable. No human power. 

- So this is a ‘value’ of blockchain. With it, we can make a decentralized autonomous organization. Why do we need this? Because! No middleman. That’s the thing that we want. No Human Resources that do all of those shitty things. Automate the driving, gas station, or even driving.

	- I don’t really get the thing of decentralized. If it’s decentralized, the data won’t be corrupt? I guess. That is a really big thing to think about eh? Yes, that is it. 

## Business Use Cases of Blockchain Beyond of Bitcoin

### Supply Chain Management

- Wallmart blockchain example

## Limitations of Blockchain Technology

### Early Stage

- Well, this is pretty obvious. It’s pretty much of when a new technology comes out and there are a lot of limitations of that.  You can think about the thing of Kotlin. Where everyone started to go with it, but simply didn’t really get with it lol. I know, it’s pretty much hard because of that. Early stage means a lot of risks. You have to do everything by yourself.

### Lack of Awareness

- Not many people really much knows about the new tech!  This will be pretty much get solved in time. 

### Limited Available Technical Talent

- This gets solved in time as well but pretty much the problem is, people really need to know and want to study about blockchain. Start to create things with it. Which will make everything go wild. I’m not sure where to actually go with but, I’m sure I’d like to actually create something with it. With the use cases, I really want to see whether it takes me anywhere. 

	- The next talent, could be me. Not sure where to specialize but, still, I’m going with machine learning and blockchain. So don’t really worry about it. I’m going to study maths and physics, so really, don’t worry. I’ll get there and destroy everything with my knowledge.

### It is Immutable

- This is a great thing, but bad if you really need to update! Yeah, CRUD? Without the update and delete. Which is pretty cool. What kind of things should we need? This is pretty much the most hardest thing that we have. I think auditing should go with blockchain. Where we all trust each other. Payments, that should be deeply centralized. But yeah, that pretty much is the problem.

	- In a start up like where I work, it’s not going to be easy if you don’t have the power to actually update the payment information. Like when the server is down, or some other situations. That will kill the hell out of us. 

		- CRUD X CR O I think immutable means this. You cannot update or delete. You can only create and read. Which means you really have to focus on the things that you really want to make and not. So I pretty much think, you should just make one component that can be immutable.

### No Reversals or Modifications

- Yeah, immutable means this. You can’t update, delete. Which you can’t fix history. No reversing. 

### Key Management

- Can’t believe this! You have to manage your keys… Well this is something that we could solve right? Find a way and you could get rich!!!! Well it’s just something though lol.

### Scalability

- Well well well, isn’t this dude my part. Since I’m a backend developer, I have to scale things up and make everything scalable. I’m sure I could come up with something to solve this problem. But I think bitcoin is actually pretty much scaling nicely. And I’m not sure whether we actually need bitcoin on our computers anyway. 

### Time to Process

- Bitcoin: You need 10 minutes!

- Yes, this is something. Everything wants to reduce this time to actually nanoseconds. Maybe micro. But this really has to be true because it’s actual transaction of value! Something really bad could happen between the god damn time. Reducing the time to process is a really big thing to do. 

## Common Misconceptions About Blockchain and Bitcoin

### Bitcoin is Anonymous.

- You aren’t because you have an identifier, which is your bitcoin address. It’s a permanent record and everyone in the world will be able to see it! Pseudonomous

	- KYC = Know your customer

### Bitcoin is Used to Launder Money

- Well you can’t launder because everyone can know this!

### Blockchain is a Better Database

- Well, actually blockchain isn’t even a database. It Also saves the blocks as chronological order. Which means it’s not relational or whatever. You have to read it, create a block and that’s it. Finished and done. 

### Blockchain is Bitcoin

- Noooooo, well, Bitcoin is made of Blockchain, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin IS Blockchain. Bitcoin is run by the technology of blockchain. Okay?

### You Need to Buy a Full Bitcoin

- You can buy 0.1, 0.001, and they are called Satoshi. 

## What is Bitcoin Cash?

### A new cryptocurrency developed from a “Hard Fork” in the Bitcoin Blockchain

### Increases block size to 8MB from the 1MB limit prior to the fork

- Segwit = scaling proposal

- coinmarketcap.com

- blockchair.com

- blockdozer.com

## On Forks and Segregated Witness (SegWit)

### SegWit

- Protocol Upgrade Improves Scalability without increasing Block size Addresses Transaction Malleability(유연성) Does not require upgrading to remain on the Blockchain Did not cause a split in chain

	- segwit.party

	- Block Size: 1MB Block Weight: The actual memory that the block has.  SegWit reduces the memory with the transaction elements. Which are input, amount, and output. So it contains the input and amount information in the digital signature. 

- SegWit2x: Possible hard fork in November. 

	- You should find out more about this. The Bitcoin will get a 2MB size. If it’s a hard fork, then there will be a separate chain. Is this Bitcoin Gold? I’m not sure. 

### Hard Fork

- What’s a Fork? A Fork takes place when a blockchain splits into two different paths forward.

	- Mempool? Where the orphan blocks are stored

	- Problems when the miners win at the same time!

- Introduces a change that forces everyone to upgrade

- UAHF: User Activated Hard Fork

### Soft Fork

- Introduces change that is backwards compatible. Doesn’t need upgrade

- Bitcoin w/ Segwit

- UASF: User Activated Soft Fork

### Contents of a Bitcoin Transaction

- It’s similar as a check.

- Input

- Amount

- Output
