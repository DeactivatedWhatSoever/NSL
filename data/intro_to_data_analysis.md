# Intro to Data Analysis
I'm just going to listen to lesson one. Since it just gives me the overall idea of what a data analyst does and what kind of skills I'll need to actually do that stuff. I saw that all the other lessons(which are 2 and 3) only teach about using Pandas, Numpy and those libraries you use for data analysis. I'm going to learn that stuff in the `Python for Data Analysis` book. 

## Problems Solved by Data Analysts
Actually trying to predict something. Finding patterns, finding value inside data. 

## Data Analysis Process
1. Question
	1. Ask questions that you want to answer.
2. Wrangle
	1. Data acquisition
	2. Data cleaning
3. Explore
	1. Build intuition
	2. Find patterns
4. Draw Conclusions
	1. Or make predictions
	2. Usually requires statistics or machine learning
5. Communicate
	1. Blog post, paper, email, powerpoint, conversation
	2. Data visualization

So I'll be mostly investigating with financial data. Or data from the apps that I make. You can question first, or question about the data that you acquired. You need to clean it, and find patterns or build intuitions. Just exploring! If you explored enough and found a high percentage of what you saw, you can make predictions. 

## Data Analysis and Related Terms
Data Science
* Similar to data analysis
* More focused on building systems
	* Recommendation systems, ranking algorithm, etc.
* May require more experience

Data Engineering
* More focused on data wrangling
* Involves data storage and processing

Big Data
* Fuzzy term for "a lot" of data
* Data analysts, scientists, and engineers can all work with big data.
