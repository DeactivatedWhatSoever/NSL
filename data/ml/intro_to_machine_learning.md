# Intro to Machine Learning
It's Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning. I'm going to listen to ML and Deep Learning and see whether I can handle the material ASAP. And then go for the machine learning nanodegree. If I just go without having to know anything, Iâ€™ll be stuck and I won't be able to finish the nanodegree at a fast pace. So that's why I'm taking this first, and for my future. Lets go!
