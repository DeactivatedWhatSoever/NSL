# Intro to Machine Learning
It's Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning. I'm going to listen to ML and Deep Learning and see whether I can handle the material ASAP. And then go for the machine learning nanodegree. If I just go without having to know anything, Iâ€™ll be stuck and I won't be able to finish the nanodegree at a fast pace. So that's why I'm taking this first, and for my future. Lets go!

## Welcome to Machine Learning
Just the introduction!

### Introduction, Part 1
It's just about introducing the people who are going to teach us. Sebastian Thrun, the dude who made the Google Self Driving Car team. And a physician! 
1. Machine learning algorithms
2. Interesting datasets
3. Machine learning process

### Introduction, Part 2
Optimizing products with machine learning algorithm! Tells us some examples of applications from other companies in Silicon Valley. 

### Introduction, Part 3
Learn the stuff in the class, and at the end of the lesson, you'll do mini projects, and you'll do a huge project at the end of the class.

### Prerequisites
* Python programming experience
* Statistics!
	* Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
	* Okay, do I need to learn the introduction to statistics course? I'm not sure, but I think I have to.
