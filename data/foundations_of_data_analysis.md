# Foundations of Data Analysis
`Class Central` says that this is the best course for learning descriptive and inferential statistics. Because of how we actually code the examples with a programming language. Which is a really good thing! I’m just going to go with this and then see the probability one from MIT. Let’s get it done.
 Also, this course is divided into two parts. But I’m just going to unify it both and it’ll be 12 weeks! It’s just for convenience.
