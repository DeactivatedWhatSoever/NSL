# Mastering Python Networking
The reason I’m reading this book is, I want to know networking. But Python is a really good language to actually do some utility stuff. So that’s why I picked this book. I get to work with Ansbile, get to know about actually fiddling with networking equipment. Create a VM and actually fiddle with SDN’s and all that kind of networking stuff. From this, I think I could actually get to know the socket layers and tinkle with all that stuff. If I get to know that, I bet that I’ll get a whole new understanding of networking. 
 If I don’t get enough, I bet my next book will be that huge networking book in Korea. That CISCO thingy or whatever lol.

## TCP/IP Protocol & Reviewing Python
What do you think you’ll learn in this chapter?
-> I think I’ll just learn about the TCP/IP Protocol and some Python syntax. But I’ll sure learn a lot about the network layers. To actually get to know the TCP/IP Protocol, we actually need to know what it is and how it got needed. So we’ll definitely get on with the 7 OSI layers. Hope I get this right.
